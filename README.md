# My Ethereum Token Smart Contract

The My Ethereum Token smart contract allows you to create and manage a custom cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain. This ERC-20-like token is designed to support essential token management features such as minting (creating new tokens) and burning (destroying existing tokens). The contract serves as a foundational template for understanding and working with Ethereum-based tokens.

Features

Token Details: View and manage the tokenâ€™s name, abbreviation, and total supply.

Balance Management: Track and manage token balances for various addresses.

Minting: Create new tokens and allocate them to specified addresses.

Burning: Destroy tokens from specified addresses, with checks to ensure sufficient balance.

## Description

The My Ethereum Token smart contract is a basic implementation of a cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain, using Solidity. It offers fundamental functionalities required for token management, including:

Minting: Increase the total supply of tokens and credit a specified address.

Burning: Decrease the total supply of tokens and debit a specified address, provided there is a sufficient balance.

This simple implementation is an excellent starting point for those looking to understand token management on Ethereum.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

Prerequisites

Remix IDE: An online Solidity integrated development environment.


Execution Instructions

Access Remix IDE: Go to Remix.


Create a New File:

Click the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar to create a new file.

Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).

Insert the Code: Copy and paste the following Solidity code into your new file:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.18;

    contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Thappar UNIVERSITY";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "TU";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
        if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
            totalSupply -= _value;
            balances[_address] -= _value;
        }
    }
    }


Compile the Contract:

Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

Ensure the compiler version is set to 0.8.18.

Click "Compile MyToken.sol".


Deploy the Contract:

Navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

Select "MyToken" from the contract dropdown menu.

Click "Deploy".


Interact with the Deployed Contract:

Under "Deployed Contracts", expand the deployed MyToken contract.

You can interact with the contract using the following functions:

tokenName: Click to view the token name.

tokenAbbrv: Click to view the token abbreviation.

totalSupply: Click to view the total supply of tokens.

balances: Enter an address to view its token balance.

mint: Enter an address and a value, then click to mint new tokens.

burn: Enter an address and a value, then click to burn tokens.
