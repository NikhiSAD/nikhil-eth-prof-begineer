# My Ethereum Token Smart Contract

The My Ethereum Token smart contract allows you to create and manage a custom cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain. This ERC-20-like token is designed to support essential token management features such as minting (creating new tokens) and burning (destroying existing tokens). The contract serves as a foundational template for understanding and working with Ethereum-based tokens.

Features

Token Details: View and manage the tokenâ€™s name, abbreviation, and total supply.

Balance Management: Track and manage token balances for various addresses.

Minting: Create new tokens and allocate them to specified addresses.

Burning: Destroy tokens from specified addresses, with checks to ensure sufficient balance.

## Description

The My Ethereum Token smart contract is a basic implementation of an Ethereum token. It provides essential functionalities needed for managing a custom cryptocurrency token:

Minting: This function allows the creation of new tokens, increasing the total supply and allocating tokens to a specified address.

Burning: This function enables the destruction of tokens, reducing the total supply and deducting tokens from a specified address, given that the address has enough tokens.

Key Points in the Code:

Token Details:


tokenName: The name of the token.

tokenAbbrv: The abbreviation of the token.

totalSupply: The total number of tokens currently in circulation.

Balance Mapping:

balances: A mapping from addresses to their token balances.

Mint Function:


Increases the totalSupply by the specified _value.

Adds the _value to the balance of the specified _address.

Includes a require statement to ensure that the value being minted is positive.

Burn Function:


Decreases the totalSupply by the specified _value.

Deducts the _value from the balance of the specified _address.

Includes require statements to ensure that the value being burned is positive and that the address has sufficient balance.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

Prerequisites

Remix IDE: An online Solidity integrated development environment.


Execution Instructions

Access Remix IDE: Go to Remix.


Create a New File:

Click the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar to create a new file.

Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).

Insert the Code: Copy and paste the following Solidity code into your new file:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.18;

    contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Thappar UNIVERSITY";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "TU";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
        if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
            totalSupply -= _value;
            balances[_address] -= _value;
        }
    }
    }


Compile the Contract:

Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

Ensure the compiler version is set to 0.8.18.

Click "Compile MyToken.sol".


Deploy the Contract:

Navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

Select "MyToken" from the contract dropdown menu.

Click "Deploy".


Interact with the Deployed Contract:

Under "Deployed Contracts", expand the deployed MyToken contract.

You can interact with the contract using the following functions:

tokenName: Click to view the token name.

tokenAbbrv: Click to view the token abbreviation.

totalSupply: Click to view the total supply of tokens.

balances: Enter an address to view its token balance.

mint: Enter an address and a value, then click to mint new tokens.

burn: Enter an address and a value, then click to burn tokens.

## Help

Common Problems and Solutions

Error: Insufficient balance to burn:

Ensure that the address you're trying to burn tokens from has enough tokens to cover the burn amount.

Error: Mint value must be greater than zero:

Verify that the _value parameter in the mint function is greater than zero.

Error: Burn value must be greater than zero:

Ensure that the _value parameter in the burn function is greater than zero.

Contract not deploying:

Check if you are using the correct compiler version.
